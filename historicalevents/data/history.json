        "text": "Prehistory spans millions of years before the development of writing, up to approximately 3,500 B.C. During this time, the first hominids emerged in Africa and spread throughout the world. It was a period of significant cultural and technological innovations, such as the creation of stone tools, the control of fire, and the development of early art forms, such as cave paintings. The study of prehistory is divided into three major periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each marking important advances in the lives of early humans."

During this period, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, moving around in search of food and resources. Simple tools made of stone, bone, and wood were created to hunt and process food. The discovery of fire was a crucial milestone, allowing people to cook food, protect themselves from predators, and keep warm in cold climates. The development of rudimentary language and the first artistic expressions, such as cave paintings, also occurred during this period."

Climate change at the end of the last ice age led to human adaptation and the development of new subsistence techniques. More sophisticated tools, such as microliths, small stone blades, were created for hunting small animals and fishing. The first attempts at domestication of plants and animals also began during this period, signaling the slow shift from a nomadic lifestyle to the beginnings of agriculture and more settled communities."

Agriculture became established, allowing the cultivation of grains such as wheat and barley, and the domestication of animals such as sheep and goats. These changes made it possible for permanent villages to emerge, such as Çatalhüyük in present-day Turkey. Society began to become stratified, with the division of labor and the emergence of community leaders. The production of pottery, weaving and the construction of megalithic monuments, such as Stonehenge, are other landmarks of this period."

The revelation of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, is considered by Muslims to be the final word of God (Allah), and Muhammad's teachings form the basis of Sharia, the Islamic code of law. Islam preaches submission to God, the practice of five essential pillars (faith, prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage), and the importance of justice and compassion. The religion quickly spread throughout Arabia, and after Muhammad's death, it gave rise to a vast empire that stretched from Spain to India, profoundly influencing history, culture, and science."

He initially faced opposition in Mecca, but after migrating to Medina (the Hijra), he established an Islamic community that unified the Arab tribes under Islam. Muhammad led military and political campaigns that expanded Islamic influence throughout the Arabian Peninsula. After his death, his followers continued to expand Islam, creating a vast empire."

It began with the conquest of the Americas following the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492, leading to the colonization of vast territories in Latin America, the Philippines, and parts of Africa. The empire was characterized by the intensive exploitation of resources, especially gold and silver, and the imposition of Christianity on indigenous populations. The Spanish Empire also played a central role in the religious and political wars of Europe. Over time, the empire declined due to wars, colonial revolts, and economic hardships, culminating in the loss of its American colonies in the early 19th century."

The empire was fueled by trade in spices, sugar, slaves, and other valuable resources. The colonization of Brazil was especially significant, leading to the formation of a large economy based on agriculture and mining. However, the empire declined in the 17th century due to competition with other European powers and the loss of colonies, culminating in Brazil's independence in 1822."

Garibaldi was a fervent advocate of liberty and the republic, and his popularity and military skills were essential to the success of the unification movement. Although his republican ideals did not always align with the monarchy, his contribution to Italian unification is undeniable."

Before unification, Germany consisted of numerous independent states, of which Prussia and Austria were the most powerful. The unification process was led by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who used a policy of 'blood and iron' to unify the German states under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. The wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1870–1871) were decisive in achieving unification. Victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War led to the proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles in 1871, with King William I of Prussia being crowned as the first Kaiser of a unified Germany."

The war was characterized by trench warfare, the use of new military technologies such as tanks and aircraft, and unprecedented destruction. The war resulted in the deaths of millions of soldiers and civilians and led to the collapse of empires, including those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire.

Among the main causes were heightened nationalism, imperialist rivalries, growing militarism, and secret alliances. Imperialist competition among the great European powers created global tensions, while nationalism inflamed ethnic and regional rivalries. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist in 1914 was the immediate trigger, but the war was largely fueled by the arms race and the belief that a short, decisive war could resolve tensions. Alliances between the powers (the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance) transformed a regional conflict in the Balkans into a world war. War was also seen as inevitable by many military and political leaders, who believed that the balance of power in Europe could only be maintained through a decisive conflict."

Mao mobilized the youth, forming the Red Guards, to attack intellectuals, party officials, and other perceived enemies of the revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, millions of people were persecuted, humiliated, tortured, and in many cases killed. Cultural, educational, and religious institutions were devastated, and the economy suffered severely. The Cultural Revolution left a legacy of trauma and cultural destruction that profoundly affected Chinese society. After Mao's death in 1976, the Cultural Revolution was officially condemned by the Chinese Communist Party as a catastrophic mistake."

Coups d'état, such as the 1973 coup in Chile, and brutal military regimes, such as those in Argentina and Brazil, were common, often resulting in violent repression, disappearances, and human rights violations. US influence in the region was expressed through the Monroe Doctrine and CIA interventions, while the Soviet Union sought to expand its influence through support for leftist movements.

The price of oil quadrupled, leading to a severe recession in industrialized countries.

Although there was no direct military confrontation between the two nations, the world lived under the constant threat of nuclear war. The Cold War led to the formation of military blocs, such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and influenced conflicts in many parts of the world, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The space race and the arms race also marked this period. The Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991."

Financial inclusion enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the economy, fostering economic growth, poverty reduction and financial resilience. Efforts to promote financial inclusion include expanding access to bank accounts, credit, insurance and digital payment services, especially in rural areas and among low-income populations. Innovation in financial technology (fintech), such as mobile payments and microfinance platforms, is playing a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion by enabling people previously excluded from the formal financial system to access these services. However, challenges remain, such as the need for financial literacy, consumer protection and effective regulation to ensure that financial inclusion is equitable and sustainable."

In France, the revolt was motivated by dissatisfaction with the government of King Louis Philippe, who represented the interests of the bourgeoisie at the expense of the working classes. The revolution began with protests and barricades in Paris, leading to the abdication of the king and the proclamation of the Second Republic. However, the Republic soon faced internal divisions between moderate liberals and radical socialists, culminating in repression and the establishment of the authoritarian presidency of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, who would later become Emperor Napoleon III."

The central event of the Restoration was the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of imperial power under Emperor Meiji. Under Meiji's leadership, Japan underwent radical reforms in all spheres of society, including military modernization, the development of an industrial economy, and the adoption of a Western educational system. These changes transformed Japan into a regional power and paved the way for its rise as a major player on the international stage, culminating in the victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)."

The movement for unification was driven by figures such as Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and the statesman Count of Cavour. Mazzini was an early advocate of a unified and republican Italy, while Garibaldi led decisive military campaigns, such as the Expedition of the Thousand, which conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Cavour, as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, used diplomacy to gain the support of France and secure the annexation of territories. The unification culminated in the capture of Rome, which became the capital of the new Kingdom of Italy."

Convened by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the conference aimed to settle the dispute between European countries over the possession of African territories and to avoid direct conflicts between them. The decisions taken at the conference resulted in the division of the African continent into colonies controlled by powers such as Great Britain, France, Germany and Belgium, often disregarding existing ethnic and cultural boundaries. The Berlin Conference marked the beginning of the era of Imperialism in Africa, which had profound and lasting consequences for the continent, including economic exploitation, the imposition of European cultures and anti-colonial resistance."

The crisis began when the United States discovered that the Soviet Union was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from the U.S. coast. President John F. Kennedy ordered a naval blockade of Cuba and demanded the removal of the missiles. After 13 days of intense negotiations, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey. The crisis resulted in a temporary easing of tensions, but it also demonstrated the imminent threat of nuclear war during the Cold War."

Officially established in 1948, apartheid was a system of racial discrimination that segregated the South African population on the basis of ethnicity and imposed severe restrictions on the rights of the black majority. The struggle against apartheid was led by figures such as Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC), who faced decades of repression. After intense domestic and international pressure, the South African government, under the leadership of F.W. de Klerk, began negotiations that led to the end of apartheid and the first multiracial elections in 1994, in which Mandela was elected president."

The wall, erected in 1961 by East Germany to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the West, became an icon of the division between the communist East and the capitalist West. In 1989, a wave of pro-democracy protests swept the Eastern Bloc, and the East German government, under pressure for political and social change, announced the opening of its borders. Thousands of Berliners from both East and West gathered to tear down the wall, celebrating the reunification of Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the transition of many Eastern European countries to democracy and a market economy."
